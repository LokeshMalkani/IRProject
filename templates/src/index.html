              <div id="introToFarmerProtest" class="row">
                <p>The 2020–2021 <b>Indian farmers' protest</b> is an ongoing protest against three farm acts which were
                  passed by the Parliament of India in September 2020. As of 21 March 2021, according to Haryana Police,
                  there are around 40,000 committed protestors sitting at Singhu and Tikri at the Delhi border.</p>

                <p>Farmer unions and their representatives have demanded that the laws be repealed and have stated that
                  they will not accept a compromise.[10][11][12][13] Farmer leaders have welcomed the Supreme Court of
                  India stay order on the implementation of the farm laws but rejected the committee appointed by the
                  Supreme Court.[14] Farmer leaders have also rejected a government proposal, dated 21 January 2021, of
                  suspending the laws for 18 months.[15] Eleven rounds of talks have taken place between the central
                  government and farmers represented by the farm unions between 14 October 2020 and 22 January 2021; all
                  were inconclusive.[16][15] On 3 February, farmer leaders warned of escalating the protest to
                  overthrowing the government if the farm laws were not repealed.[17][18] The stay order on the
                  implementation of the farm laws remains in effect,[19] and the Supreme Court appointed committee
                  continues with its tasks related to the farm laws.[20] Six state governments (Kerala, Punjab,
                  Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Delhi and West Bengal) have passed resolutions against the farms acts,[21]
                  and
                  three states (Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan) have tabled counter legislation in their respective
                  state assemblies.[22] None of the counter legislation passed the respective state governors</p>
                <p>The acts, often called the Farm Bills,[26] have been described as "anti-farmer laws" by many farmer
                  unions,[27][28] and politicians from the opposition also say it would leave farmers at the "mercy of
                  corporates".[29][30] The farmers have also demanded the creation of an Minimum Support Price (MSP)
                  bill,
                  to ensure that corporates cannot control the prices. The government, however, maintains that the laws
                  will make it effortless for farmers to sell their produce directly to big buyers, and stated that the
                  protests are based on misinformation</p>
                <p>Soon after the acts were introduced, unions began holding local protests, mostly in Punjab. After two
                  months of protests, farmer unions—mainly from Punjab and Haryana—began a movement named Dilhi Chalo
                  (transl. Let's go to Delhi), in which tens of thousands of farming union members marched towards the
                  nation's capital. The Indian government ordered the police and law enforcement of various states to
                  attack the protesters using water cannons, batons, and tear gas to prevent the farmer unions from
                  entering into Haryana first and then Delhi. On 26 November 2020, a nationwide general strike of 250
                  million people, as per trade unions claim, took place in support of the farmer unions.[34] On 30
                  November, an estimated crowd of 200,000 and 300,000 farmers was converging at various border points on
                  the way to Delhi.[35] On 21 March specific mention was made of Bengaluru, "….you (farmers) have to
                  turn
                  Bengaluru into Delhi. You will have to lay siege to the city from all directions".[36] Transport
                  unions
                  representing over 14 million truck drivers have come out in support of the farmer unions.[37] On 26
                  January, tens of thousands of the farmers held a farmer's parade with a large convoy of tractors and
                  drove into Delhi. The protesters deviated from the pre-sanctioned routes permitted by the Delhi
                  Police.[38][39][40][41] The tractor rally turned into a violent protest at certain points as the
                  protesting farmers drove through the barricades and clashed with the police.[42] Later protesters
                  reached Red Fort and installed farmer union flags and religious flags on the mast on the rampart of
                  the
                  Red Fort</p>
                <p>While a section of farmer unions have been protesting, the Indian Government claims some unions have
                  come out in support of the farm laws.[47][48] By mid December, the Supreme Court of India had received
                  a
                  batch of petitions asking for removal blockades created by the protesters around Delhi.[49][50] The
                  court also asked the government to put the laws on hold, which they refused.[51] On 4 January 2021 the
                  court registered the first plea filed in favour of the protesting farmers.[52] Farmers have said they
                  will not listen to the courts if told to back off.[53] Their leaders have also said that staying the
                  farm laws is not a solution.[54] The government offered some amendments in laws.[55] On 30 December,
                  the
                  Indian Government agreed to two of the farmers' demands; excluding farmers from laws curbing stubble
                  burning and dropping amendments to the new Electricity Ordinance</p>
